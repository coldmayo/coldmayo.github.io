                He's a male Trodatome from a planet at the edge of Hutt Space called Troda. He always had an affinity for 
                engineering and mechanics. His life would change when he came into contact with Chewbacca who convinced him to join
                the Resistance as a mechanic. He would then accompany them on various missions and would gain a good reputuation from the likes of
                Princess Leia Organa and Finn. As a result of his popularity, he was included in Star Wars: Skywalker Saga
                and other characters of his species were put in other pieces of media.
